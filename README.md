This project provides a numerical approximation of the solution of Schr√∂dinger's equation, utilizing the Strang-splitting method.
Different potentials and initial wavefunctions can be used, a few are already provided in the code. The numerical approximation remains good for smooth potentials and initial conditions, otherwise other numerical methods have to be used.
